**In OpenGL, we implemented a billiard board with one ball moving in a region bounded by planes. Also, we implemented a magic cube that makes a transition between a sphere and an octahedron.**

**In Rasterization, we develop the raster-based graphics pipeline used in OpenGL. The pipeline can be thought of as a series of six stages. We implement roughly 4 stages of the pipeline. They are: Stage 1: modeling transformation, Stage 2: view transformation, Stage 3: projection transformation and  Stage 4: clipping & scan conversion using Z-buffer algorithm.**

**In the final assignment, we generate realistic images for a few geometric shapes using ray tracing with appropriate illumination techniques(phong lightning model,recursive reflection).**
