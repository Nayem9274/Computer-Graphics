In OpenGL, we implemented a billiard board with one ball moving in a region bounded by planes. Also, we implemented a magic cube that makes a transition between a sphere and an octahedron.

In Rasterization, we implemented Z-buffer

In the final assignment, we generate realistic images for a few geometric shapes using ray tracing with appropriate illumination techniques.
